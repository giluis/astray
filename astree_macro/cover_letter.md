My name is Lu√≠s. I am a Software Engineer experienced in critical systems, QA and Full Stack development
Why hire me? 
What makes me stand out is my drive and my values
- Life long leader and team member: I have managed a team of interns and plenty of personal experience managing people and conflicts, through volunteering and directing a choir over the past 5 years. 
- Useful and autonomous: With enough time and an internet connection, I can learn anything on my own. I won't get anyone's way and will be up to date with the rest of team quickly.
- Impeccable communication skills:  with a long family history in literature and teaching, I love and excel at clearly describing ideas to anyone. I find this to be essential in my profession, both through speech and writing/documentaion.
- Sincere: I will be honest with you and won't tell you what I think you want to hear. To me, this is fundamental for building confidence inside a team.

What will I bring as a backend developer?
- Great documentation
