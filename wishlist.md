# Implement Iterator<T> for TokenIterator<T>
- Allows usage of iterator methods
- replaces `fn consume(&mut self)` with `fn next(&mut self)`, which is more intuitive in Rust land
- parse_until might be

# Functional macro for enum optimization
Enum variants can have parsable types in common. This is sub optimal


# Parsing visualization for the command line (bonus points if also works in the browser)


# Documenting all functions in the code


#  Updating nomenclature
Consumable types -> Parsable types

# Generic Errors instead of ParseError
Not sure if this is a good idea
