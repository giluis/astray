# Introduction

Astray is a framework for building type safe parsing functions from Rust type definitions. 
It helps you do this with ease and correction.

This doc book is (or hopes to be) a repository for all Astray features and rules. It is, like the rest of the project, a work in progress.

Please check out the [wishlist](./wishlist.md) for small breakdown of what has not been implemented so far.

## Main goals

Besides fullfilling its purpose as a parsing framework, Astray has a few non-functional goals:
- Correctness and type safety over performance (although performance improvements are welcome)
- Extensive and prolific use of the Rust type system
- Thorough and beginner friendly documentation

## Contributing

No rules so far, just open an issue and we'll talk about it. Eventually, contributing rules will be made available [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md) 

Have fun and let me know if something in the book isn't quite right!
